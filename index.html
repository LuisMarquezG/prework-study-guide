          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>
            The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.

            Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a
            document that contains thematic content.
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML uses the id attribute as a way to identify elements and select
            them.
          </li>
          <li>The attribute class works in a similar way to the id.</li>
          <li>The tag ul is for creating unordered lists.</li>
          <li>
            Inside the ul element we need to wrap each item in a li element.
            Each one represents a new bullet point in our list.

            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.

            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside

            Inline CCS: For styling an element directly on the HTML file,
            inlines styles apply to an specific html tag.

          <li>
            Internal style sheet: In the HTML file using a style element in the
            head element, this contains rules only apply to that page, I can
            configure CSS classes and IDs.
          </li>
          <li>
            External CSS style sheet: This is preferred in most cases because it
            allows to keep all CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design
            changes easier and using the principle called "Separation of
            Concerns".

            Selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that

            DRY: Don't repeat yourself, optimize reusing or sharing pieces of

            git commit -m"message": To create a snapshot of he staged changes
            along a timeline of a Git projects history. We use the -m flag to

            descriptive messages of the changes implemented.

            git pull origin main: To check that our working branch is sync with

            I use the element script to link HTML document with the JavaScript

          </li>
          <li>
            Control Flow: In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at
            the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the
            page.
          </li>

            Arrays: An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group
            of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in
            some way.
          </li>
          <li>
            Array Index: The location of the data item in the array. This
            location is identified with a unique number called an index. First
            position = 0, JS is zero-indexed and sequential.
          </li>
          <li>
            The for Loop: A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to
            perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single
            code block to be executed over and over.
          </li>
          <li>
            The array length is a built-in property, and the length is important
            because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run
            until there are no items left in the array.
          </li>
          <li>
            (les 3.5.5) 3 for loop's statments: for (starting point for our
            loop; condition; the final statement is what allows the array to
            iterate over each item) for (var techs = 0; techs 'angle bracket
            here' topics.length; techs++)
